    <h1>Description</h1>  
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <p><li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li></p>
        <p><li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li></p>
        <p><li>2 large eggs</li></p>
        <p><li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li></p>
        <p><li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li></p>
        <p><li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li></p>
        <p><li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li></p>
        <p><li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li></p>
        <p><li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li></p>
        <p><li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li></p>
        <p><li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li></p>
        <p><li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li></p>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li></p>
        <p><li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li></p>
        <p><li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li></p>
        <p><li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li></p>
        <p><li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li></p>
        <p><li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li></p>
        <p><li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li></p>
        <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li></p>
